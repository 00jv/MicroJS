# Project Name

This project is an example of a Microfrontends architecture, where multiple teams can work on different parts of the application independently, using different technologies and frameworks.

## Architecture

The application is composed of multiple Microfrontends, each responsible for a specific feature or functionality. Each Microfrontend is a standalone application, built using a different technology or framework, and can be deployed and updated independently.

The Microfrontends communicate with each other using a shared API, which defines the contract between them. This allows each team to work on their Microfrontend without worrying about the implementation details of the others.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to start each Microfrontend separately. Each Microfrontend has its own README file with instructions on how to run it.

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory of the Microfrontend you want to run
3. Follow the instructions in the README file of that Microfrontend
